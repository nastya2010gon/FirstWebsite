        <center><p>Hello Friends, I’m NANA a filmmaker and artist. I’m currently studying in the Film & Video major at California Institute of the Arts in Santa Clarita. I started out working in more traditional mediums such as oil paint and although I still enjoy this medium, I also like to experiment. This is why I steadily moved onto more non-traditional or common mediums. Such as embroidery, clay then photography as well as digital drawing. And finally, I also dabbled in animation and video where I eventually decided to focus. Too see some of my works visit the projects page! Thank you for visiting my website and enjoy! </p></center>
